# Knowledge Assessment Test

Web application for creating and solving various tests. Web application is written with HTML5, CSS3, JS, JQuery and PHP.

# Instructions
 
1. Import WebDiPx044.sql SQL script in MySQL Database (I used XAMPP Apache for local hosting and XAMPP MySQL for storing database).
2. Copy project to xampp/htdocs folder and open http://localhost/project_root_folder_name in your browser.
3. Voila! It's done.

P.S. Project documentation and description can be found at http://localhost/project_root_folder_name/dokumentacija.html only in Croatian language (for now) :).
